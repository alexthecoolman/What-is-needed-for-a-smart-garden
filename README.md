# What-is-needed-for-a-smart-garden
The idea behind this project is to bring together in one place the various elements I have developed to automate the watering of my terrace. The goal is to share. I have had to solve different problems, and this can be useful to others. 

# Presentation
A water tank, Home assistant, pump, valve etc ... all things for watering.

# PlanterMonitor
Monitor if there is still water in self-watering planters and send data to Home assistant.
